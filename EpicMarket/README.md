## Introduction

The NFTUnityMarket project focuses on creating a secure platform for trading digital assets through Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It addresses the challenges of centralized storage systems for digital assets and explores the technical feasibility of a decentralized file system using the IPFS protocol. The project aims to promote the use of blockchain technology for secure and transparent transactions.



## Background and Basics

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital certificates of authenticity representing ownership of unique items. Stored on a blockchain, NFTs ensure secure, immutable ownership records. The report emphasizes the importance of metadata, smart contracts, and blockchain technology in ensuring the uniqueness and verifiability of NFTs.

## Implementation Details

### System Use-Case Overview

The Use-Case diagram outlines functional requirements, including browsing the marketplace, viewing items, buying/selling NFT assets, participating in auctions, and minting NFTs.(coming soon)

### System Backend Overview

The backend involves key classes like Admin, User, Collection Item, Listed Item, and more. Smart Contracts play a crucial role, with interfaces like IERC721 and concrete classes for NFT minting, trading, and auctions.(coming soon)

### Architecture Overview

The project's architecture comprises a React Client, Metamask Wallet, Nodejs Backend, Distributed File System, Ethereum Blockchain, and Smart Contracts. Each component plays a vital role in ensuring a smooth and secure user experience.

### Data Flow of Preliminary Model

The Data Flow Diagram illustrates the buying process of NFT assets, emphasizing user interactions, wallet approvals, and transaction records.(coming soon)

### Business Rules

The project adheres to essential business rules, including codes of conduct, smart contracts, platform terms of service, terms of sale, intellectual property protection, payments, and data privacy.(coming soon)

### Project Process Modelling

The project follows agile project management, promoting an iterative approach for adaptability and releasing benefits throughout the development process.

## Limitations and Exclusions

The document outlines limitations, emphasizing the non-legal tender status of cryptocurrency in many countries, user risks, and the project's technical demonstration nature.

## Safety Requirements

The safety requirements focus on blockchain protection, avoiding duplicity, ensuring transaction atomicity, returning auction funds securely, and maintaining data redundancy.
